# Image-Steganography-Tool
APIs allowing user to hide message inside image

# Description
This self-learning project aims to hide messages in different formats such as text, image in another image, and demonstrate how it works with infographics, and example image processor program.

# Motivation
So this idea came from the thought of "I want to explain/build something I don't understand at all at the beginning". While I was reading about image encyption, I came across this thing: image steganography. The examples are very cool. While I have been a programmer for some time I rarely deal with images so I think this can be a good start for me.

# Existing work
There are a lot of research papers about this. And I even found an online tool which does mostly the same thing I want to do with the images. So my goal is to support more data format in the encoding. And also combine the tool with the infographic to make the project more suitable for educating purposes.

# Scope and Deliverables
1. **[COMPLETED] ** 1-2 page infographic explaining what it is, how it works, and where itâ€™s used. - [Image Steganography.pdf](https://github.com/celine1013/Image-Steganography-Tool/files/6176624/Image.Steganography.pdf)

2. A message processor program which provides below functionality:
  - **[COMPLETED] ** The user can provide a text or image to the processor, and they will get another image which has the message/image hidden in it.
  - **[COMPLETED] ** The user can provide an image with hidden message to the processor, and they will get the original message extracted. (The range of the supplied images will be limited)
  - (Optional) Message in other format such as audio is also supported
